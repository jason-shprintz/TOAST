# Dark Mode Feature

## Overview
The TOAST app now supports dark mode with three theme options that can be configured in the Settings modal.

## Theme Options

### 1. Light Mode (Default)
- Classic light theme with warm, natural colors
- Uses the original color palette
- Best for daytime use and well-lit environments

### 2. Dark Mode
- Dark theme optimized for low-light conditions
- Inverted color scheme with darker backgrounds
- Reduces eye strain in dark environments
- Better for nighttime use and battery life (on OLED screens)

### 3. System
- Automatically matches your device's system theme setting
- Switches between light and dark as your system preference changes
- Provides seamless integration with your device's appearance settings

## How to Change Theme

1. Tap the **Settings icon** (gear icon) in the top-right corner of any screen
2. In the Settings modal, scroll to the **Theme** section
3. Select your preferred theme:
   - **Light Mode** - Always use light theme
   - **Dark Mode** - Always use dark theme

## Technical Details
